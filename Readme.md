#Inventory Manager
This is and Inventory Mangement system that uses ABC analysis to rank items according to their importance. Changes to the inventory can be inputted via google forms.

### How does this program work?
The script that is used to update the inventory is updateInventory.sh. It downloads from google sheets the csv file linked to google form and updates the inventory (in data/inventory.csv).
